				I believe that incorporating the voice of both the rich and the poor in the governance 
				of society is what will bring about true development. But the situation now is that the 
				rich and the descendants of the rich have access to higher education opportunities and they 
				continue to take leadership positions. Chances are that the kids of the rich have the same values 
				and ideologies as their parents and they would be enforcing those same ideas generation after generation. 
				From what we have seen already these ideologies don’t work for developing countries like Malawi. 
				Developing countries need new and improved development strategies, and it is the kids of the poor people that 
				can bring these fresh ideas to the table if given a chance.<br></br>

				In all the years that I studied developing countries, one thing that I took from my studies was that education 
				of the poor and the marginalized is the main answer to most of the problems that developing nations are facing. 
				But now I see that fairness is as equally important and should go together with this education. In Malawi for example,
				 most women’s potentials and skills are being hindered by the actions and policies of men. As a result most women are 
				 making less or no contribution to the development of society. This calls for change, and the job of bringing about this
				 change is best for someone who has knowledge of public service law, is dedicated to fighting for human rights, and has 
				 passion for serving the poor and also the marginalized. This is the kind of work I am truly passionate about. I am inspired
				 and motivated to earn an education that will enable me to become this responsible and helpful individual.
